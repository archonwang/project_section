# Redmine Project Sections Plugin

The Project Sections plugin can be used to split projects in [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) into groups, i.e., to categorize them.
Project sections get prepended to project names and URLs, in this way making them more descriptive and providing quick links to other projects in sections.

Additionally, this plugin makes it possible to have project section specific custom fields (which are available only for projects of the selected sections).

For more information check [the project page](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/project/redmine/project-sections) of the plugin.
If you found any issues, report them [there](http://projects.andriylesyuk.com/projects/project-sections/issues).
